# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** May 3, 2025

This privacy policy describes how your data is handled by the **Summies**.

## Information We Collect

The Extension may collect the following information:

* **Page Content**: The Extension reads the content of web pages linked from the current page to provide summarization functionality. This content is processed temporarily and is not stored unless explicitly saved by the user.
* **Saved Summaries**: If the user chooses to save a summary, it is stored securely in their Supabase account.
* **Authentication (Optional)**: If the Extension uses Supabase Auth, we may collect your email address solely for login and user identification purposes.

We do **not** collect or store personally identifiable information unless explicitly provided by the user (e.g., email address during sign-in).

## How We Use the Information

The information collected is used strictly for:

* Summarizing content of linked web pages
* Saving summaries to user accounts
* Improving the browsing experience

We do **not** sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.

## Data Retention

Saved summaries are retained in your Supabase account until you choose to delete them. No page content or summary history is stored unless you explicitly save it.

## Data Security

We use Supabase services to store user data securely. All data transfers are encrypted using HTTPS.

## User Rights

You can:

* View or delete saved summaries at any time
* Revoke Supabase access by logging out or deleting your account

## Third-party Services

The Extension integrates with:

* **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for language processing
* **Supabase** for backend storage and authentication

These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.
